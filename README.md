# CodeDrops

Some projects are too small to have their own repository. Some projects are too big to be on a gist. But what if a project is both too small and too big to belong in any of those? That's why I'm dropping my code here.

These are my CodeDrops. Feel free to take a sip anytime. Just remember to tell your friends about it. ðŸ˜‰
